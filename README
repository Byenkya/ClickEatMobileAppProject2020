Project Overview

This repository contains a mobile application project that I originally developed in 2020. The project was an exciting learning experience at the time, and I am now revisiting it to refactor the code and bring it up to speed with the latest best practices in Kotlin.

About the Project

Type: Mobile Application

Initial Development Year: 2020

Primary Language: Kotlin

The application was designed with a specific set of features and functionality in mind, but as software development practices evolve, so must the code. The goal is to modernize the codebase by:

Improving readability and maintainability.

Incorporating modern Kotlin features (e.g., coroutines, extension functions).

Adopting a clean architecture.

Enhancing performance and efficiency.

Why Refactor?

In the years since this project was first built, Kotlin and Android development have seen significant advancements. By revisiting this project:

I aim to apply my current understanding of modern software development principles.

This serves as an opportunity for continuous learning and skill sharpening.

Work in Progress

Please note that this repository is currently under active development. The code may not represent the final structure or follow all best practices yet, as it is being incrementally improved.

Contributions

At this stage, contributions are not being accepted since the focus is on personal learning and refactoring.

Future Goals

Once the refactoring process is complete, I plan to:

Write detailed documentation about the updated architecture and features.

Explore potential enhancements or features that could be added.
